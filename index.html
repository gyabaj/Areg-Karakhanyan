  <p><h3>Musicians are natural-born Programmers. 
     Both professions deal with abstract concepts. 
     In addition, musicians and programmers conceptualize their media in a hierarchical organization. 
     When musicians think about Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, they see it as a singular work that is divided into different movements,
     each of which is further divided into sections, phrases, bars, and single notes. 
     Programmers think about their programs in a similar manner. The words in an individual line of program code correspond to the notes on a page of music. 
     Programs even have repeats and first and second endings in the form of loops and cases.</h3></p>
